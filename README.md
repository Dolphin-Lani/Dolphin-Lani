## `thulani@dev:~$ cat about_me.md`

I design and build software that solves real-world problems, with a strong focus on scalability, reliability, and user experience. My work spans mobile, backend, and data-driven systems.

Alongside development, I actively conduct independent research in areas related to software architecture, databases, and efficient system design. I’m particularly interested in how theoretical ideas translate into practical, production-ready solutions.
